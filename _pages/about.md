   I am a first-year doctoral student from [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn). Having dedicated nine years at Tianjin University, I have been engaged in the fields of computer vision and image reconstruction for the past four years. My research interests span a variety of domains including object detection, salient object detection, video anomaly detection, 3D reconstruction, fusion-based aerial-ground localization systems, and model compression. Currently, my latest work on video anomaly detection is underway.
   I am very fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Zhang Wei](http://faculty.tju.edu.cn/027886/zh_CN/index.htm) from the [Digital Signal Processing & RF Analog Integrated Circuit Design Laboratory](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qa6vTqODYB9mmEGBRZ5cPQ) of [Tianjin University's School of Microelectronics](https://www.sme.tju.edu.cn).
